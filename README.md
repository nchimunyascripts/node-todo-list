## Overview

Provide a brief overview of your project. Describe its purpose and target audience. Mention the main features and functionalities.

## Features

List the key features of your application:
- User authentication with JWT
- CRUD operations for tasks
- Pagination for task listing
- Redis caching for improved performance

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Redis
- JWT for authentication
- Express-session for session management
- Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling
- Connect-redis for Redis session storage
- Other libraries or frameworks used (if applicable)

## Getting Started

Provide instructions on setting up and running your application locally.

### Prerequisites

List any software dependencies and how to install them:
- Node.js (version x.x.x)
- MongoDB (installation guide link)
- Redis (installation guide link)

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
cd repository-name
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```
By default, the application runs on `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Endpoints

Document your API endpoints and their functionalities. For example:

- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /api/auth/login`: Authenticate and login a user.
- `GET /api/todos`: Fetch all tasks.
- `POST /api/todos`: Create a new task.
- `PUT /api/todos/:id`: Update an existing task.
- `DELETE /api/todos/:id`: Delete a task.

Include request and response examples if possible.

## Architecture

Describe the architecture of your application. Include diagrams or visuals if helpful.

## Development

Share your experience during the development phase.

### Successes

Highlight achievements or successful implementations (e.g., integrating Redis caching).

### Challenges

Discuss challenges faced and how you overcame them (e.g., handling Redis v4+ compatibility).

### Areas for Improvement

Identify areas that could be improved or optimized (e.g., better error handling in authentication).

### Lessons Learned

List key lessons learned during the project (e.g., importance of session management with Redis).

### Next Steps

Outline future plans for the project (e.g., adding real-time notifications, deploying to production).
